# survival_workshop

This repository  contains material sufficient for a short course or workshop in survival analysis using R.  The repository contains R-Markdown source for lectures and labs and some relevant background reading.  The labs require a full installation of LaTeX to produce pdf output for lab exercises.

Since these lectures were originally designed for an introductory course of 5 3-hour lectures, the material covers only nonparametric methods for estimation and testing for right-censored data, and the use of the proportional hazards regression model.

The slides for Unit 1 contain instructions for downloading the necessary packages for the course.
